This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is available, causing unexpected behavior in your app. This is particularly problematic when the app is launched directly from a deep link, as the expected URL is lost. The issue seems intermittent and doesn't happen consistently across devices or OS versions.
